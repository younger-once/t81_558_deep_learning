This section will demonstrate how to train an LSTM on a textual document, such as classic literature, and learn to output new text that appears to be of the same form as the training material. If you train your LSTM on [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), it will learn to crank out new prose similar to what Shakespeare had written. \n",

However, this technology gets so much interest because it forms the foundation for many more advanced technologies.

The ability to output free-form text has become the foundation of many other technologies.

The LSTM is learning to construct its own words without even being shown what a word is. We will begin with character-level text generation. In the next module, we will see how we can use nearly the same technique to operate at the word level. We will implement word-level automatic captioning in the next module.\n",
